this is an ongoing effort to document the code base used in the project as well as make it somewhat less shabby in the process. The code here contains here only one sample collection of photos along withits meta data. 

TODO, a.k.a the most pressing issues:
* finish the map generating code (viewer.php -> map.js)
* clean up the licensing mess
